# Kubernetes Multi-Tenancy Runtime Verification

This project tests **runtime verification for Kubernetes multi-tenancy** using TLA+ and Kubernetes audit logs. The idea is to monitor whatâ€™s happening in the cluster and check that tenants don't step over each other (for example, pods only get scheduled on their own nodes).

---

## Files

- `alerts/`: logs of detected violations (in JSON, one per line)
- `logs/`: sample Kubernetes audit logs (violation + no-violation cases)
- `run_results/`: CSVs tracking TLC runs (times + if violations were found)
- `tla_specs/`: the TLA+ specs:
  - `NodeIsolationSystem.tla`: defines the **expected system behavior**
  - `node_isolation.tla`: trace-checking spec for **runtime verification**
  - `Json.tla`: helper module for parsing JSON logs
- `java/`: simple Java runner scripts:
  - `SplitThenRun.java`: splits audit logs into batches and runs TLC for each
  - `TenantLoadSimulator.java`: (if included) simulates tenants for testing
- `cluster-audit-policy.yaml`: audit policy to capture **create/update/delete** events
- `fluent-bit-config.conf`: example config to filter audit logs with Fluent Bit
- `pom.xml`: Java build config (Maven)

## How it works

1. **Logs**: We collect Kubernetes audit logs (in this case pod creation across tenants).
2. **Specs**: TLA+ specs define what should/shouldnâ€™t happen (like: tenant1â€™s pod shouldn't land on tenant2â€™s node).
3. **Runtime checking**: 
   - Logs are split into batches.
   - TLC runs on each batch to check if the invariant holds.
   - Alerts + timings are logged.

## ðŸ›  Running it

- **Build Java:**  
  Run `mvn package` to compile the Java runner.

- **Run the checker:**  
  Example usage (adjust paths as needed):

  ```bash
  java -cp target/k8s-monitoring-tla-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/path/to/tla2tools.jar \
    k8s.monitoring.tla.SplitThenRun \
    /path/to/logs/node_isolation_violation.json \
    /path/to/tla_specs/node_isolation.tla \
    /path/to/node_isolation.cfg \
    /path/to/alloc.json \
    /path/to/tla2tools.jar
  ```

- **Output:**
  - Results go to `run_results/`
  - Alerts (if any) are written in `alerts/`

---

## What this shows

- How fast TLC can process different batch sizes (timing results in CSVs)
- That the TLA+ spec **detects violations** (example logs included)
- Example setup that could be expanded for **real-time Kubernetes monitoring**

---

## Relevance

- Uses **formal methods (TLA+)** to check **real-world Kubernetes logs**
- Tests **multi-tenancy isolation** at runtime (e.g., tenant boundaries)
- Can be expanded into a continuous monitoring tool
